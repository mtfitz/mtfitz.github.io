## RTI Avionics Demo

In the summer of 2023, I interned at Real-Time Innovations (RTI), an IoT middleware company.
There, I designed and implemented a demo suite to highlight use cases of RTI's software in avionics.
This was a fun experience: not only did I refine my development skills, from the web to the low-level, but at the program's conclusion I pitched my project to sales engineers.
Through this opportunity, I've learned some important lessons about computing and how the public perceives a software company.

Key points:
- Web controller in JavaScript using React
- Control virtual aircraft via DDS publisher-subscriber model
- Integration with flight simulators using a custom low-latency C++ adapter

## Blendus

As an avid user of Blender, a 3D modeling and animation suite, I'm curious about ways to distribute the rendering process for 3D animations. Blendus is an ongoing cloud-based solution that connects a web client with distributed rendering machines.

Key points:
- Web front end in TypeScript and React
- Auth, projects and jobs tracked using PostgreSQL and a secure REST API via Supabase
- Python daemon integration with Blender


## Swarms Lab Robotics

Key points:
- Exploration of perception and localization strategies for aerial robots
- Integration of cameras and sensors with ARM-based firmware using C
- Comparison of deep learning algorithms on embedded devices
